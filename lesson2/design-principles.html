                         Applying Hick’s Law is giving the users the choice to decide an ideas in a simplier way.
                         The more choices the users see or being presented , the longer it will take them to reach
                          a decision. </p>

                       <p> Hick's Law is a design that is accessible to the users, easy to understand and make advance
                        interpretation and decision.</p>

                        The concept of Proximity are grouped together and closely related, It makes the design more 
                        distinguish and organize. The users will have a quick access as he search and avoid any confusion 
                        to items category. </p>

                   <p>The rule of thirds capture the viewer's eye using other methods such as leading lines, contrast, color, 
                       symmetry, etc. It is one of the easiest to successfully break, simply break up an image into thirds
                        both horizontally and vertically, as seen here.</p>
