                Applying design-principles in the Web will help the readers find things easily. Sometimes, the reader's attention
                doesn't focused on the websites name but on how the principles of design is applied that gives clarity to what he 
                is searching for.</p>

                             Hick’s Law is a simple idea that says that the more choices you present your users with, 
                             the longer it will take them to reach a decision.
                             The more stimuli to choose from, the longer it takes the user to make a decision on which
                             one to interact with. Users bombarded with choices 
                             have to take time to interpret and decide, giving them work they don’t want.

                            The Principle of Proximity states: Group related items together. Move them physically close to each
                            other so the related items are seen as one cohesive group rather than a bunch of unrelated bits.
                            Items or groups of information that are not related to each other should not be in close proximity (nearness) to the other elements,
                            which gives the reader an instant visual clue to the organization and content of the page.A very 
                            simple example, below, illustrates this concept. That’s the Principle of Proximity—on a page 
                            (as in Life), physical closeness implies a relationship.

                            <p>The rule of thirds is one of the easiest to successfully break, simply break up an image into thirds both horizontally
                                and vertically, as seen here. The four intersection points of these lines, and the four lines themselves,
                                 are where subjects, or strong compositional lines of a photograph, can be placed to create a strong, balanced image.
                                 Framing an image so that subjects or lines don't fall on the rule of thirds areas can 
                                 still create a successful image, as long as the lines and other elements in the image do create a strong 
                                 overall image, and capture the viewer's eye using other methods such as leading lines, contrast, color, 
                                 symmetry, etc.</p>
